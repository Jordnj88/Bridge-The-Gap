Ben Lindgren’s Scholarship Journey
Here are some of the questions I had regarding scholarships when I was in high school:

Where do I find scholarships?
Do I need a new essay every time?
Should I apply for "small" ones?
What happens after receiving a scholarship?
What happens if I get more scholarships than tuition?
Should I continue to apply for scholarships after beginning school?
Here’s what I learned from those questions:

Where do I find scholarships?
Talk to your guidance counselors—they know about local and community scholarships.
Ask your parents if their employers offer any scholarships (mine offered both local and national ones).
Research national scholarships.
Check for opportunities at the university you're attending—many offer scholarships.
There are lots of scholarships out there—you just have to find them and put in the effort to apply.
Do I need a new essay every time?
No. Many applications ask similar questions.
Write every essay in Word or Google Docs and save it—you’ll likely reuse it with small edits.
Should I apply for "small" scholarships?
Absolutely. Small scholarships add up—they’re money out of your pocket saved.
A $500 scholarship that takes 2 hours to apply for is like earning $250/hour!
What happens after receiving a scholarship?
Each scholarship is different—stay organized and meet requirements (like submitting grades, tuition statements, etc.).
Write a thank-you letter. Donors love hearing from recipients, and I even turned one-time scholarships into renewables by doing this.
Track important dates—don’t lose a scholarship due to missed paperwork.
What happens if I get more scholarships than tuition?
Ask if you can defer the scholarship to the next year. Many are okay with that if you just ask.
Should I continue to apply for scholarships after starting college?
This is crucial—don’t stop after freshman year!
Many scholarships are available for all stages of college. Most people stop applying and leave money on the table.
How much did scholarships help me?
A 4-year engineering degree from UW-Stout costs about $69,000 (including room & board for 2 years). Scholarships covered nearly all of it.

Total scholarships: 25
Total amount: ~$70,000
