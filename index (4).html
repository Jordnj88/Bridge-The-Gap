        <strong>Ben Lindgren’s Scholarship Journey</strong>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Here are some of the questions I had regarding scholarships when I was in high school:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where do I find scholarships?</li>
                <li>Do I need a new essay every time?</li>
                <li>Should I apply for "small" ones?</li>
                <li>What happens after receiving a scholarship?</li>
                <li>What happens if I get more scholarships than tuition?</li>
                <li>Should I continue to apply for scholarships after beginning school?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s what I learned from those questions:</p>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>Where do I find scholarships?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talk to your guidance counselors—they know about local and community scholarships.</li>
                    <li>Ask your parents if their employers offer any scholarships (mine offered both local and national ones).</li>
                    <li>Research national scholarships.</li>
                    <li>Check for opportunities at the university you're attending—many offer scholarships.</li>
                    <li>There are lots of scholarships out there—you just have to find them and put in the effort to apply.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>Do I need a new essay every time?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>No. Many applications ask similar questions.</li>
                    <li>Write every essay in Word or Google Docs and save it—you’ll likely reuse it with small edits.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>Should I apply for "small" scholarships?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Absolutely. Small scholarships add up—they’re money out of your pocket saved.</li>
                    <li>A $500 scholarship that takes 2 hours to apply for is like earning $250/hour!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>What happens after receiving a scholarship?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each scholarship is different—stay organized and meet requirements (like submitting grades, tuition statements, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Write a thank-you letter. Donors love hearing from recipients, and I even turned one-time scholarships into renewables by doing this.</li>
                    <li>Track important dates—don’t lose a scholarship due to missed paperwork.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>What happens if I get more scholarships than tuition?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask if you can defer the scholarship to the next year. Many are okay with that if you just ask.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>Should I continue to apply for scholarships after starting college?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is crucial—don’t stop after freshman year!</li>
                    <li>Many scholarships are available for all stages of college. Most people stop applying and leave money on the table.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-section">
                <strong>How much did scholarships help me?</strong>
                <p>A 4-year engineering degree from UW-Stout costs about $69,000 (including room & board for 2 years). Scholarships covered nearly all of it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total scholarships: 25</li>
                    <li>Total amount: ~$70,000</li>
                    <li>Nestle Local Scholarship – $3,000</li>
                    <li>Nestle USA College Scholarship – $5,000/year = $20,000</li>
                    <li>Joseph and Betty Prohaska Scholarship – $2,500/year = $10,000</li>
                    <li>Lions Club – $500</li>
                    <li>Marvin and Janice Kufahl Endowed Packaging Scholarship – $1,500</li>
                </ul>

            <em>Recap from "Bridging the Gap – The Next Chapter of Life":</em>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uncertainty is Normal</strong> – It’s okay not to have everything figured out. Direction comes through experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Family & Peer Pressure</strong> – Everyone's journey is different; comparing yourself doesn't define your worth.</li>
                <li><strong>Help is Out There</strong> – Support is available through school, community, and people who care.</li>
                <li><strong>4-4-4 Breathing</strong> – Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, out for 4 — a tool to calm your body and clear your mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Naming the Noise</strong> – Self-doubt is common. Use tools like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flexibility – Life can change and still lead to success.</li>
                        <li>Purpose – Take small, meaningful steps forward.</li>
                        <li>Self-compassion – Progress > perfection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>STOP, DROP, & ROLL Grounding Exercise</strong> – A technique to relieve stress by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acknowledging your stress</li>
                        <li>Connecting with your body</li>
                        <li>Focusing on a calming point</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Final Message</strong> – You don’t need all the answers. Just keep showing up.</li>
